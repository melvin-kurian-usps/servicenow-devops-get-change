long_doc_string: |
    In order to utilize the automated CR/Deployment process, this file will
    need to be added to the root level of your deployment repository.

    The values below (some optional) should be populated with the parameters used
    to create a CR for this application(s). If you make them kind of generic,
    you won't have to update this file very often.

    For some of these values, like the "default_justification" field, you will
    probably want to use a multiline string. Because this file is YAML, you can
    use any of the usual methods for multiline strings to do this, such as this one,
    the '|'.

    You can use the following placeholders in these fields: {ENVIRONMENT}, {NEW_VALUE},
    {SUBFOLDER_FILTER}, {FILENAME_FILTER}, {REPO}, {start_date}, {end_date}, and
    {requesting_user}. The all caps values will be replaced with the values supplied
    when you request a deployment. The other values are calculated at execution time.

    The additional placeholders: {requesting_user}, {starttime}, and {endtime} will
    be substituted with appropriate values determined at runtime.

    By default, your github username (e.g. john-a-smith-usps) will be used to infer
    your ServiceNow username (e.g., John A Smith) when you submit a deployment request.
    If your github username doesn't match this pattern, or if you would like Change
    Requests to be owned by a specific person, you can provide their ServiceNow user
    name in the "default_creator_name" parameter.

# u_tslc_activity must be one of the following values:
